# SlackParser Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This repository contains a plan and tools to refactor the SlackParser application from a monolithic structure to a modular one. The goal is to improve code organization, maintainability, and testability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Files

1. **refactoring_plan.md**: High-level overview of the refactoring goals, proposed module structure, and strategy.
2. **refactoring_implementation.md**: Detailed step-by-step guide for implementing the refactoring plan.
3. **refactor.sh**: Bash script to automate the creation of the directory structure and empty files.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you're on the `refactor/modularize-codebase` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout refactor/modularize-codebase
   ```

2. Run the refactoring script to set up the directory structure:
   ```bash
   ./refactor.sh
   ```

3. Follow the steps in `refactoring_implementation.md` to move code from `main.py` to the new modules.

## Refactoring Approach

The refactoring will be done in phases:

1. **Setup**: Create the directory structure and empty files.
2. **Extract**: Move code from `main.py` to the appropriate modules without changing logic.
3. **Integrate**: Update imports and ensure all modules work together.
4. **Test**: Verify that all functionality works as before.

## Testing

After each significant change, run the existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved:

```bash
cd app
python -m pytest
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can roll back to the original code:

1. Discard changes to `main.py`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -- app/main.py
   ```

2. Delete the new modules:
   ```bash
   rm -rf app/api app/services app/utils
   rm -rf app/db/repositories
   ```

3. Switch back to the original branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/admin-improvements
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Commit frequently with descriptive messages.
2. Test after each significant change.
3. Keep the original code until the refactoring is complete and verified.
4. Document any unexpected behavior or edge cases.

## Next Steps

Once the refactoring is complete:

1. Update the documentation.
2. Create a pull request for review.
3. Merge the changes into the main branch after approval.
